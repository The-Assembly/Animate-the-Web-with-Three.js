# Animate-the-Web-with-Three.js
Three.js is a revolutionary open-source cross-platform JavaScript API and library that is used to create and display 3D computer graphics in a desktop web browser using WebGL, working at a high level to create GPU-accelerated animations without the need for plugins or external applications. The library comes packed with features not commonly associated with the web, including on-the-fly lighting effects, multiple camera angles, object geometry &amp; material manipulation, and even VR/AR support through WebXR. In this session, we’ll cover the basics of the library and demonstrate how to code websites with 3D backgrounds, as well as show you how to bring 3D models onto the page for a whole new end-user experience you might not have thought possible before.
